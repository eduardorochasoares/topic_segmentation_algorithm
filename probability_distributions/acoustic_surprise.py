 * A Ring buffer that calculates the (windowed) mean/variance/surprise.
 * Since it is a template class, you can also use data vectors, matrices,
 * etc. and calculate the (independent) variance/surprise for each element.
 *
 * This is a simple demonstration implementation. If you consider to use it
 * for real applications, then you need to take care about the numerical
 * stability! E.g., you can use the full data buffer to recalculate the
 * variance/mean non-iterative at some intervals (e.g., after every 1000
 * pushes) - however, this leads to a discontinuity. Well, that's where
 * you need to get creative and I don't want to spoil the fun ;)
 * (see, e.g., "Variance Estimation over Sliding Windows", 2007, L. Zhang
 *  and Y. Guan and/or "Maintaining variance and k-medians over data stream
 *  windows", 2003, B. Babcock, M. Datar, R. Motwani, and L. Oâ€™Callaghan.)
 *
 * This is a prototypic implementation (small & simple). Windowed Gaussian
 * surprise has been applied/presented in [1] to calculate the auditory
 * saliency / auditory surprise (acoustic surprise) using spectrograms.
